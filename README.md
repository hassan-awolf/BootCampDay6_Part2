# BootCampDay6_Part2
Project contains exercise from BootCamp Day 6 Lab Part 2. 

Main_Question1 contains the code and unit tests for question 1 in part 2. 
  
  Question 1: Write three (3) functions that compute the sum of the
              numbers in a list:
      a. One using a for loop
      b. One using a while loop
      c. One using recursion

Main_Question2 contains the code and unit tests for question 2 in part 2. 

  Question 2: Write a function that rotates a list by k k elements. For
              example, [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two (2) becomes
              [3,4,5,6,1,2].

Main_Question3 contains the code and unit tests for question 3 in part 2. 

  Question 3: Write a function that merges two sorted lists into a new
              sorted list. For example, [1,4,6], [2,3,5] =>
              [1,2,3,4,5,6].

All code is functional, meets the requirements, and has 100% test coverage.
